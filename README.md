# Description
LabExperio is a simulator built using Unity and C#. It's intended for university students, particularly those taking physics courses. This simulator lets students perform their physics class experiments on a computer, creating a virtual lab environment. Through this virtual lab, students can engage with and explore various physics phenomena, freeing them from the need to share outdated physical equipment and enabling a more dynamic learning experience.


#### Lab 1:
The goal of the lab is to investigate the influence of a surface-active substance on the free energy per unit surface of a liquid (surface tension coefficient).    
*Clarification: To determine how specific system settings can affect the liquid level in the pressure gauge.*

Controls: 
- To change the concentration of the solution, click on the glass with the desired concentration and swap it with the main glass.
- To adjust the position of the main glass, hover the mouse over it and scroll the wheel.
- To adjust the valve's opening degree, hover the mouse over it and scroll the wheel.


#### The list of implemented labs will probalby be updated over time.
