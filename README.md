# Description
LabExperio is a simulator built using Unity and C#. It's intended for university students, particularly those taking physics courses. This simulator lets students perform their physics class experiments on a computer, creating a virtual lab environment. Through this virtual lab, students can engage with and explore various physics phenomena, freeing them from the need to share outdated physical equipment and enabling a more dynamic learning experience.
